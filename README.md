## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Django**: Backend framework for web development.
- **Python**: The foundation for building robust models and logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the front-end.

## 🎯 Goals and Purpose
### Why I built this:
- **Learning goal**: Experimented with Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, gaining experience in data modeling and developing a potentially useful website from scratch.
- **Inspiration**: This was a project inspired by my experience as an associate at David Gooding Inc. and working with the company software and tracking system. I made this project with the hope of implementing my own logic and creativity on the way warehouse inventory could be managed and how shipments can be tracked.
